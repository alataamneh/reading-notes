** Version Control: is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of 
                    a file or set of files by recording changes.

   * Local Version Control: entails one database on your hard disk that stores 
                            changes to files.
   * Centralized Version Control: entails a single server storing all changes and
                                  file versions, which can be accessed by various
                                    clients.
   * Distributed Version Control: allows clients to create mirrored repositories.
                                  These data backups can be easily be placed on the 
                                  server to replace any lost information.

** Git:
      * is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
      * relies on local operations because most necessary information can
        be found in local resources.
      * and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online 
        or on a VPN.
      * Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
      * is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files.
      * Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

** After creating new repo and write it's name and description, we can choose the 
settings of that repo whether to make it public one or private, and to choose if 
we wanna add a readme file to this repo or not. 

** As the repo now is ready on the Git account, we can edit the repo online on the 
Git account or even clone it to the local machine and start working on it on our 
code editor. and then push the updated version of the file into the Git library. 

** ACP, is the process of Adding the new changes to the file, Committing  the changes 
with an abbreviated message, Pushing the final version to the Git online. 

** we can work on the file in the local machine in a new branch of the file and then 
after pushing the file back to the Git we can use the merge property to combine the 
new updated changes to the original version of the file.
