***CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.***

***A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.***

***Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.***

***Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value),and are separated by a colon***

**You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:**

1-RGB values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 
For example: rgb(100,100,90).

2-HEX codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
For example: #ee3e80.

3-Color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.
For example: DarkCyan.

***You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page).***

***When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.***

***The opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).***
